# netdog

netdog is a minimal, command-line networking utility inspired by Netcat. It enables you to quickly establish TCP or UDP connections—either as a server or a client—and transfer data with ease.

## What It Does

Operate in both client and server modes.

Support for TCP and UDP transport protocols.

Allow execution of a command with the -e option when a client connects — the client’s input/output is then piped directly to the process.

Ideal for quick network checks, data piping, or real-time testing between hosts.

## Why Use netdog?

Great for:

Simple connectivity testing between machines.

Piping or redirecting data over the network.

Lightweight and flexible usage—perfect for developers and power users who want a tool that just works, without bloat.

## Project Status

Inspired by Netcat, but specifically focused on being lightweight and easy to maintain.

Actively under development—expect continuous improvements and new features in future updates.
